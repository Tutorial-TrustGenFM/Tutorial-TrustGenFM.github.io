                <p>Generative foundation models (GenFMs), such as large language and multimodal models, are transforming information access, retrieval, and knowledge systems. However, their deployment raises critical concerns around social responsibility, including fairness, bias mitigation, environmental impact, misinformation, and safety. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of recent research and best practices at the intersection of GFMs and responsible AI. We introduce foundational concepts, evaluation metrics, and mitigation strategies, with case studies across various domains (e.g., text, vision, code). The tutorial is designed for researchers and practitioners interested in building or auditing socially responsible GFMs. We highlight open challenges and propose future research directions relevant to the CIKM community.</p>

                <h3>The Dual Nature of GenFMs and the Need for Responsibility (20 minutes)</h3>
                <p>We begin by outlining the growing impact of Generative Foundation Models (GenFMs) in real-world systems and why ensuring their responsible behavior is a critical challenge. GenFMs serve in two primary roles: as <em>assistants</em>, they help users accomplish daily tasks such as creative writing, translation, code generation, and search augmentation; as <em>simulators</em>, they generate synthetic data, simulate user behavior, or model complex scenarios, especially used in scientific studies. These roles demonstrate that GenFMs are no longer passive technologies—they actively shape how individuals interact with information and systems. As GenFMs gain broader adoption in search engines, conversational agents, recommendation systems, and decision-making pipelines, their influence over knowledge access and user experience grows. This elevates the importance of building <em>responsible and trustworthy</em> GenFMs. We motivate this need by highlighting societal risks such as misinformation, exclusionary bias, and unintended memorization. These concerns are especially relevant to the CIKM community, whose core interests include information retrieval, data management, and the deployment of intelligent systems in real-world settings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Understanding Social Responsibility: Taxonomy and Case Studies (45 minutes)</h3>
                <p>This part presents a structured understanding of the major risks and responsibility dimensions in GenFMs. We introduce a taxonomy that covers most of the responsibility and trustworthiness-related dimensions: <strong>Safety:</strong> Preventing outputs that cause harm or enable malicious behavior. <strong>Privacy:</strong> Avoiding unintended memorization or exposure of sensitive data. <strong>Robustness:</strong> Ensuring stability under distribution shifts and adversarial prompts. <strong>Truthfulness:</strong> Reducing hallucinations and factual inaccuracies. <strong>Fairness:</strong> Addressing demographic, geographic, or ideological biases. <strong>Machine Ethics:</strong> Focusing on ensuring that AI-powered machines exhibit ethically acceptable behavior.</p>
                <p>Each dimension is grounded in illustrative case studies from both open-source and commercial GenFMs. We examine well-documented failures, including biased healthcare advice, offensive language generation, and identity leakage. These cases demonstrate how technical issues translate into measurable societal harms. To deepen participants’ understanding, we integrate hands-on exercises where attendees explore failure modes using curated prompts and open-source diagnostic tools (e.g., toxicity detectors like OpenAI moderator as well as Llama Guard, and bias probes).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Evaluation and Benchmarks (20 minutes)</h3>
                <p>We introduce the first phase of the 2E strategy: <em>Evaluation</em>. Participants will learn about widely used benchmarks and diagnostic datasets, such as traditional datasets—BBQ, TruthfulQA, and RealToxicityPrompts, and novel benchmarks like HarmBench, TrustLLM, and DecodingTrust. We will also introduce the metrics for evaluating fairness, safety, and so on. We also present tools like OpenAI Evals, TrustEval, and AI Fairness 360. Integrated exercises will allow participants to apply these tools and observe how GenFMs behave under standard evaluation settings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Enhancement for Responsible GenFMs (20 minutes)</h3>
                <p>This section focuses on the second phase of the 2E strategy: <em>Enhancement</em>. We present strategies to mitigate model risks through interventions at different stages: data-level filtering, prompt-level steering, model fine-tuning (e.g., RLHF), and post-processing (e.g., detoxification, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)). Participants will experiment with basic mitigation techniques using provided code notebooks and re-evaluate model behavior after intervention.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Governance and Policy Perspectives (20 minutes)</h3>
                <p>Beyond technical fixes, this module explores institutional, regulatory, and industrial mechanisms for ensuring GenFM responsibility. We present recent developments such as the EU AI Act and the NIST AI RMF, as well as efforts from the open-source community (e.g., OpenRAIL, BigScience governance). In addition, we discuss major enterprise-led initiatives, such as OpenAI’s system cards and model usage guidelines, Google’s Responsible AI Principles, Meta’s Llama Responsible Use Guide, and Microsoft’s Responsible AI Standard. These industry frameworks set standards for risk assessment, transparency, and responsible deployment at scale.</p>
            </div>

            

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Open Challenges and Community Discussion (25 minutes)</h3>
                <p>In closing, we highlight three pressing open challenges for GenFM trustworthiness. First, as models and their applications continuously evolve, evaluation and mitigation strategies must be adaptive and dynamic to remain effective without sacrificing utility or user experience. Second, alignment techniques can have dual effects—improving safety in some contexts while inadvertently introducing new vulnerabilities or biases—underscoring the need for more nuanced approaches. Third, addressing advanced AI risks requires a combination of technical innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and forward-looking governance frameworks to proactively manage emerging threats.</p>
